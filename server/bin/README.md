- `--website`: Organization website URL (must be a valid URL)
- `--firstName`: Admin user's first name
- `--lastName`: Admin user's last name
- `--password`: Admin user's password (minimum 15 characters, required)

### Output

The script will output:

- Organization ID
- Organization details (name, email, website)
- Admin user ID and details
- **API Key** - This is only shown once! Copy and store it securely.

### Example Output

```
✅ Organization and admin user created successfully!

🔑 API KEY (STORE THIS SECURELY!)
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

New API key generated successfully! Please copy and store it securely.

API Key: ABC123-XYZ789-DEF456-GHI012

⚠️  This API key will not be shown again. Save it now!
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### What Gets Created

The script performs the following actions:

1. **Creates an Organization** with the provided details
2. **Generates an API Key** for the organization
3. **Creates Signing Keys** for JWT token verification
4. **Initializes Organization Settings**:
   - Default user type for moderation
   - Default user interface settings
   - Default organization settings
   - Default manual review tool settings
5. **Creates an Admin User** with:
   - Password login method enabled
   - Admin role permissions
   - Approved status

### Notes

- The API key is only displayed once. Make sure to copy and store it securely.
- The organization name and email must be unique in the database.
- The password must be strong and at least 15 characters long.
- All database connections are properly closed after the script completes.

### Troubleshooting

If the script fails:

- Check that your database connection is configured correctly in `.env`
- Verify that the organization name and email don't already exist
- Ensure the website URL is valid (must start with `http://` or `https://`)
- Check the console output for specific error messages

## recover-mrt-queue.ts

Re-enqueues items into a Manual Review Tool queue after Redis loss.

Pending MRT job payloads only live in Redis (BullMQ). When a queue is
obliterated — intentionally via the "Delete All Jobs" button, or
unintentionally via a Redis cluster reset / data loss — the items disappear
from the moderator's queue. The list of WHICH items were enqueued is
preserved in Postgres (`manual_review_tool.job_creations`); rebuilt
`reportHistory` is sourced from the data warehouse table
`REPORTING_SERVICE.REPORTS`; item bodies are re-fetched via
`ItemInvestigationService.getItemByIdentifier`, which cascades through
Scylla (`item_submission_by_thread`), the org's Partial Items endpoint,
and the data warehouse (6-month lookback) — using whichever source still
has the item.

### Usage

Get the `--queueId` from the MRT queues dashboard (the "ID" column has a
copy-to-clipboard button next to each id). The mode is auto-detected from
the queue's role in `ncmec_org_settings`, so the same command works for
both default and NCMEC queues:

```bash
# Dry run -- prints what would be re-enqueued, makes no changes
pnpm run recover-mrt-queue \
  --orgId "<orgId>" \
  --queueId "<queueId>"

# Actually re-enqueue
pnpm run recover-mrt-queue \
  --orgId "<orgId>" \
  --queueId "<queueId>" \
  --apply
```

### Parameters

- `--orgId` (required): Organization id whose queue is being recovered.
- `--queueId` (required): MRT queue id to recover into. Must already exist.
- `--mode default|ncmec` (optional): job kind to re-enqueue. Defaults to
  auto-detect: `ncmec` if `--queueId` matches the org's
  `ncmec_org_settings.default_ncmec_queue_id`, else `default`. Pass
  explicitly only to override (rare; only useful for orgs whose routing
  rules send DEFAULT jobs into the NCMEC queue, or vice versa). The
  configuration banner prints both the chosen mode and its source.
- `--since "<ISO timestamp>"` (default: 30 days ago): only consider
  `job_creations` rows after this timestamp.
- `--limit <N>` (default `10000`, max `100000`): cap on number of items.
- `--apply` (default off): actually call enqueue. Without this flag, the
  script is a dry-run and prints the items it would re-enqueue.
- `--no-report-history` (default off): skip rebuilding `reportHistory` from
  the data warehouse (useful if the warehouse is unavailable).

### Safety

- Dry-run by default. `--apply` is required to make any changes.
- Items that already have a decision in
  `manual_review_tool.manual_review_decisions` are filtered out.
- BullMQ dedupes by `(itemTypeId, itemId)` per queue, so re-running the
  script on a partially-recovered queue is safe.
- Per-item enqueue errors are logged and counted but do not abort the run.
- The script validates that `--orgId` and `--queueId` look like opaque ids
  before issuing any DB queries.

### What it does NOT recover

- The original BullMQ `JobId` values are not preserved — recovered jobs
  receive new ids derived from the item identifier.
- Item field data is whatever the cascade above can find. If the item has
  been hard-deleted from Scylla, the org has no Partial Items endpoint,
  and the warehouse 6-month lookback misses, the item is logged as
  skipped and counted in the final summary.
- Report history is best-effort: only inbound `submitReport` rows that made
  it into `REPORTING_SERVICE.REPORTS` are restored. Rule-driven enqueues
  (`ENQUEUE_TO_MRT`) never had a report history to begin with.
