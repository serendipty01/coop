/**
 * Kysely represents the type of each row as an object type (with the ability to
 * have different types per column on SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE). However, if certain
 * fields have correlated types (e.g., if column `a` can be type `X | Y` and
 * column `b` can be type `A | B`, but column `a` having type `X` implies column
 * `b` must have type `Y`), kysely has no way to capture this in query results,
 * because it computes the type of the returned selection (i.e., portion of a
 * row) on a column-by-column basis.
 *
 * This type is solely designed to work around that problem. You give it:
 *
 * - RowTypeUnion: a type for your row which contains a union type to capture
 *   the correlation between fields;
 * - SelectionType: a list of column names (optionally with aliases) matching
 *   exactly what you'd pass to `builder.select()` in kysely. This could also be
 *   a list of keys (with aliases and possibly partial) that are going to
 *   represent the row in an insert/update.
 * - ConditionalSelectionType: a kysely query can have columns that are _only
 *   sometimes_ selected using $if() calls. This type should be a list of column
 *   names (optionally with aliases) matching the conditional selection. See
 *   https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely/blob/e4de7bb8f7f22ad5d7af72dfe0285eb7a85cdd9a/site/docs/recipes/conditional-selects.md
 * - Mode: an indication of whether the produced type is supposed to represent
 *   the shape of the data as it's needed in an insert, update, or select.
 *
 * Then, it returns a union type, with only the keys in the selection and with
 * their aliases applied, for the row.
