# This is a fairly-standard multi-stage Dockerfile. We build 
# backend in a Node image, and then we copy the built files
# (but not the devDependencies [like typescript, etc.] or the raw source
# files) to final images that we'll actually run. This makes the final image a
# bit lighter and more secure. When building the backend, we always
# copy in package.json and package-lock.json first, as a distinct layer, so that
# Docker's cache will let us skip installs when the dependencies haven't changed.
# We build on debian because it has fewer dependency issues than Alpine for our
# native modules, and we don't really care about the larger image size.
