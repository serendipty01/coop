# Docker Images

Pre-built images are published to the GitHub Container Registry on every push to `main`:

```
ghcr.io/roostorg/coop-server   # API server
ghcr.io/roostorg/coop-worker   # Background worker
ghcr.io/roostorg/coop-client   # Frontend (nginx)
```

Images are tagged with `latest`, the git SHA, and semver tags on release.

## Quick start

Pull the published images and run the full stack locally with a single command:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.images.yaml up -d
```

> [!WARNING]
> `docker-compose.images.yaml` uses `.env.docker`, which ships working defaults for local evaluation but includes placeholder secrets. **Review and replace secrets before any non-local deployment.**

This starts:

- **Coop server** on port 8080
- **Coop client** (nginx) on port 3000
- **Postgres** (pgvector), **Redis**, **ScyllaDB**, **ClickHouse**
- Database migrations (run automatically)
- A seed service that creates an admin user with a randomly generated password

### Get your login credentials

The seed service prints the generated credentials to its logs:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.images.yaml logs seed
```

Look for the output at the bottom:

```
============================================
  Login:    admin@coop.local
  Password: <randomly-generated>
============================================
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and log in.

On subsequent startups (with the same volumes), the seed service detects the existing user and skips — your credentials remain the same. If you lose the password, tear down with `-v` to reset.

## Create additional users

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.images.yaml exec server \
  node bin/create-org-and-user.js \
  --name "My Org" \
  --email "you@example.com" \
  --website "https://example.com" \
  --firstName "Jane" \
  --lastName "Doe" \
  --password "your-password"
```

## Tear down

```bash
# Stop containers, keep data volumes
docker compose -f docker-compose.images.yaml down

# Stop containers and wipe all data
docker compose -f docker-compose.images.yaml down -v
```

## Upgrading PostgreSQL

When the `postgres` image version changes across a **major** PostgreSQL version (e.g. 15 → 17), the on-disk data format is incompatible. You must export your data before swapping the image, then restore it into the new container.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not skip the backup step. Deleting the `pg_data` volume without a dump will permanently destroy all data.

### Step-by-step migration

Go to your Coop docker compose directory and create a backup folder:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/coop-pg-backup
```

Stop all services except the database so nothing is writing during the export:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.images.yaml stop server migrations seed client
```

Dump the entire database cluster:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.images.yaml exec postgres \
  pg_dumpall -U postgres > ~/coop-pg-backup/pg.dump
```

Verify the dump is non-empty before continuing:

```bash
ls -lh ~/coop-pg-backup/pg.dump
# should be several MB, not 0 bytes
```

Stop the database container:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.images.yaml stop postgres
```

Pull the latest images (which includes the new PostgreSQL version):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.images.yaml pull
```

Delete the old data volume — it is incompatible with the new major version:

```bash
docker volume rm coop_pg_data
```

Start the new PostgreSQL container and wait for it to be healthy:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.images.yaml up -d postgres
docker compose -f docker-compose.images.yaml ps  # wait until postgres shows "(healthy)"
```

Restore the dump into the new container:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.images.yaml exec -T postgres \
  psql -U postgres < ~/coop-pg-backup/pg.dump
```

> [!NOTE]
> The restore will print a few harmless errors like `role "postgres" already exists` — these are expected and safe to ignore.

Start the rest of the stack:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.images.yaml up -d
```

Verify the upgrade succeeded:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.images.yaml exec postgres \
  psql -U postgres -c "SELECT version();"
```

Once everything is working you can remove the backup file:

```bash
rm ~/coop-pg-backup/pg.dump
```

## Image details

| Image         | Dockerfile          | Build target          | Base                              |
| ------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `coop-server` | `Dockerfile`        | `build_server`        | node:24-bullseye-slim + dumb-init |
| `coop-worker` | `Dockerfile`        | `build_worker_runner` | node:24-bullseye-slim + dumb-init |
| `coop-client` | `client/Dockerfile` | `serve`               | nginx:1.27-bookworm               |

The client image serves the Vite-built SPA via nginx and proxies `/api/` requests (including `/api/v1/graphql`) to a backend service named `server` on port 8080.
